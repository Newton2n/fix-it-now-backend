# 💳 Stripe Webhook

## Local Development

Start the Stripe CLI to forward webhook events to your local server.

```bash
npm run stripe:webhook
```

The command forwards events to:

```text
http://localhost:5000/api/payment/webhook
```

Copy the generated webhook signing secret and add it to your `.env` file.

```env
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
```

---

## Production (Remote Webhook)

When deploying the application, configure a webhook endpoint in the Stripe Dashboard.

**Webhook URL**

```text
https://your-domain.vercel.app/api/payment/webhook
```

Select the required event(s):

- `checkout.session.completed`

After creating the webhook, copy the webhook signing secret and update the production environment variable:

```env
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
```

> **Note:** Local and production webhooks use different signing secrets. Make sure the correct secret is configured for each environment.
